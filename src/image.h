/**
 * Images are the visual building blocks of your game.  Use images to draw on
 * screen, or as sources for sprites and fonts. Images can be read from a file
 * or created empty and can be used directly or provide frames for sprites
 * or characters for fonts.
 *
 * The simplest form of creating an image is by using create_image():
 *
 *     struct image* image;
 *     image = create_image("path/to/image.png");
 *
 * Images can also be used as a drawing target instead of the screen:
 *
 *     draw_on_image(image);
 *     // draw images, sprites or text
 *     draw_on_screen();
 *
 * You will have to explicitly get rid of any image you create
 * using destroy_image():
 *
 *     destroy_image(image);
 *
 *  Not doing so will result a memory leak.
